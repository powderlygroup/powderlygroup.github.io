# Powderly Group Research
Conventional syntheses of solid-state materials require high temperatures (>800 C) and long heating times (days to weeks) to allow atoms to diffuse and form the most thermodynamically stable phase(s) at that temperature. Many interesting materials have been discovered under these conditions; however, certain combinations of atomic structures and elemental compositions, which may give rise to desirable electronic and magnetic properties, are not accessible with conventional solid-state synthesis. We will employ alternative synthetic methods, including solution-phase synthesis to facilitate diffusion, high pressure to shift the thermodynamic landscape, and assembly of pre-synthesized building blocks for “designer” structures, to access metastable materials that exhibit quantum spin liquid behavior, superconductivity, and non-trivial topology.
